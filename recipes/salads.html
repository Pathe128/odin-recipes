    <p>Salads are versatile and refreshing dishes that typically consist of a combination of raw or cooked vegetables, fruits, proteins, grains, and dressings. They are known for their crisp textures, vibrant colors, and balanced flavors, making them popular choices for appetizers, side dishes, or even main courses. Salads can range from simple garden salads with lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, and a light vinaigrette to more complex creations like Caesar salads with grilled chicken, croutons, Parmesan cheese, and creamy dressing. </p>
